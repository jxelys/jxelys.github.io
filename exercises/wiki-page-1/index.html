            <b>Crown Shyness</b> (also 
            <i>canopy disengagement,</i><sup>[1]</sup> 
            <i>canopy shyness,</i><sup>[2]</sup> or 
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed 
            in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do 
            not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.
            <sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of 
            the same species, but also occurs between trees of different 
            species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why 
            crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it 
            might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
