                <h1>Lilium (Lily)</h1>
                <p>
                    Lilium (/ˈlɪliəm/ LIL-ee-əm)[3] is a genus of herbaceous 
                    flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large and 
                    often prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering 
                    plants which are important in culture and literature in much 
                    of the world. Most species are native to the Northern 
                    Hemisphere and their range is temperate climates and extends 
                    into the subtropics. Many other plants have "lily" in their 
                    common names, but do not belong to the same genus and are 
                    therefore not true lilies. True lilies are known to be 
                    highly toxic to cats.[4]

                <p>
                    Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 
                    1–6 ft (30–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless scaly 
                    underground bulbs which are their organs of perennation. 
                    In some North American species the base of the bulb develops 
                    into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. 
                    Some species develop stolons.[5] Most bulbs are buried deep 
                    in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil 
                    surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb 
                    grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the 
                    new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it 
                    emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the 
                    basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb, a number 
                    of species also produce contractile roots that move the 
                    bulbs deeper into the soil.

                    The flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a wide 
                    range of colors including whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, 
                    reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. 
                    The plants are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are 
                    borne in racemes or umbels at the tip of the stem, with six 
                    tepals spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from 
                    funnel shape to a "Turk's cap". The tepals are free from 
                    each other, and bear a nectary at the base of each flower. 
                    The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of attachment 
                    of the anthers. The fruit is a three-celled capsule.

                    The lily bulb or yuri-ne is sometimes used in 
                    Japanese cuisine.[c][84] It may be most familiar in the 
                    present day as an occasional ingredient (具, gu) in the 
                    chawan-mushi (savoury egg custard),[85] where a few loosened 
                    scales of this optional ingredient are found embedded in the 
                    "hot pudding" of each serving.[86][87] It could also be used 
                    as an ingredient in a clear soup or suimono [ja]. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current Japanese governmental sources (c. 2005) list the 
                    following lily species as prominent in domestic consumption:
                    [101][102] the oni yuri or tiger lily Lilium lancifolium, 
                    the kooni yuri Lilium leichtlinii var. maximowiczii,[h] and 
                    the gold-banded white yama-yuri L. auratum. But Japanese 
                    sources c. 1895–1900,[98][103] give a top-three list which 
                    replaces kooni yuri with the sukashi-yuri (透かし百合, lit. 
                    "see-through lily", L. maculatum) named from the gaps 
                    between the tepals. There is uncertainty regarding which 
                    species is meant by the hime-yuri used as food, because 
                    although this is usually the common name for L. concolor in 
                    most up-to-date literature,[106] it used to ambiguously 
                    referred to the tiger lily as well, c. 1895–1900.[98] The 
                    non-tiger-lily himeyuri is certainly described as quite 
                    palatable in the literature at the time, but the extent of 
                    exploitation could not have been as significant.

                    The flower buds and roots of Lilium columbianum are 
                    traditionally gathered and eaten by North American 
                    indigenous peoples.[107] Coast Salish, Nuu-chah-nulth and 
                    most western Washington peoples steam, boil or pit-cook the 
                    bulbs of Lilium columbianum. Bitter or peppery-tasting, they 
                    were mostly used as a flavoring, often in soup with meat or 
                    fish.

                    In the Victorian language of flowers, lilies portray love, 
                    ardor, and affection for your loved ones, while orange 
                    lilies stand for happiness, love, and warmth. Lilies are the 
                    flowers most commonly used at funerals, where they 
                    symbolically signify that the soul of the deceased has been 
                    restored to the state of innocence.

                    Lilium bulbiferum has long been recognised as a symbol of 
                    the Orange Order in Northern Ireland. Lilium mackliniae is 
                    the state flower of Manipur. Lilium michauxii, the Carolina 
                    lily, is the official state flower of North Carolina. 
                    Idyllwild, California, hosts the Lemon Lily Festival, which 
                    celebrates Lilium parryi.[120] Lilium philadelphicum is the 
                    floral emblem of Saskatchewan province in Canada, and is on 
                    the flag of Saskatchewan.
