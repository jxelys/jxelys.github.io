            <h3>MAKING THE SAUCE</h3>
            <p>
                First things first: the sauce. This is where all the magic 
                happens. Grab a bowl and mix together some ketchup, white sugar, 
                and gochujang. The ketchup gives a tangy sweetness, the sugar 
                adds just the right amount of extra sweetness, and the gochujang 
                brings that essential spicy kick. For a bit more depth, add soy 
                sauce and sesame oil to the mix. The soy sauce will add a savory 
                umami note, while the sesame oil gives a rich, nutty flavor. To 
                turn up the heat, sprinkle in some gochugaru—Korean red pepper 
                flakes are perfect for adding a touch more spice. Finally, mix 
                in a splash of warm water to help everything blend together 
                smoothly. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved and the 
                sauce is nicely combined.
            </p>
            <h3>ASSEMBLING THE SKEWERS</h3>
            <p>
                Now for the fun part: assembling the skewers. Start by threading 
                a cooked rice cake onto a wooden skewer, then add a mini beef 
                hot dog. Alternate between rice cakes and hot dogs until you’ve 
                got a skewer that’s about three rice cakes and three mini hot 
                dogs long. You can make them as short or as long as you’d like 
                though.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To cook the rice cakes, just follow the package directions for 
                whatever rice cakes you buy from the grocery store. It can take 
                anywhere between 10 to 15 minutes of boiling to soften them up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>TIP:</b>f you find that the rice cakes are very sticky and 
                have trouble going through the skewer, coat the skewer in a bit 
                of oil and this will help it glide right through.

            <h3>COOKING THE SKEWERS</h3>
            <p>
                With your skewers assembled, it’s time to cook them. Heat a pan 
                over medium heat and add just enough cooking oil to keep things 
                from sticking. Fry the skewers for about 5-7 minutes, turning 
                them occasionally so they get crispy and golden on all sides. 
                You want those rice cakes to get a nice sear and the hot dogs to 
                brown up a bit. While the skewers are still in the pan, brush 
                them generously with the sauce on both sides. Let them cook for 
                another 1-2 minutes so the sauce can caramelize and stick to the 
                skewers beautifully.
            </p>
            <h3>SERVING UP</h3>
            <p>
                Once your skewers are cooked and coated in that amazing glaze, 
                it’s time to serve. Sprinkle some sesame seeds and chopped 
                scallions on top if you like, and enjoy them hot. These skewers 
                are great on their own or paired with a side of pickled 
                vegetables for a bit of crunch and freshness. Feel free to 
                experiment with different types of rice cakes or sausages to 
                make these your own. A few chopped green onions in the sauce or 
                an extra splash of sesame oil can also add a nice touch.

            <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Prepare the Ingredients:</b> Boil the rice cakes in hot 
                    water for about 10 to 15 minutes to soften them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Assemble the Skewers</b> Thread a rice cake onto a 
                    wooden skewer, followed by a mini hot dog. Continue 
                    alternating between rice cakes and mini hot dogs until each 
                    skewer has 3 rice cakes and 3 mini hot dogs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fry the Skewers:</b> Heat a pan over medium heat and add 
                    the cooking oil. Fry the skewers for about 5-7 minutes, 
                    turning occasionally until the rice cakes are crispy on the 
                    outside and the mini hot dogs are nicely browned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Prepare the Sauce:</b> In a small bowl, mix together the 
                    ketchup, white sugar, gochujang, gochugaru, soy sauce, 
                    sesame oil, and a splash of warm water. Stir until the sugar 
                    is dissolved and the sauce is well combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Coat the Skewers:</b> Brush the cooked skewers generously 
                    with the sauce while still in the pan. Let them cook for 
                    another 1-2 minutes to allow the sauce to caramelize and 
                    adhere to the skewers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Serve:</b> Remove the skewers from the pan, sprinkle with 
                    sesame seeds if desired, and serve hot.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>TIPS & NOTES</h4>
            <p>
                If the rice cakes are not gliding on the skewer, coat the wooden 
                skewers in a bit of oil to help.
